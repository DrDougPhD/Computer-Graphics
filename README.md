# 3D Computer Graphics
This repository contains the Matlab code I wrote for a class on 3D computer graphics as an undergraduate.
This course was heavily focused on vector and matrix algebra and how these math subjects apply to 3D graphics and modeling.

# Where's the code?
Apparently I never pushed any of my code to this repository when I first created it years ago.
I need to locate it.
It's likely in an email as an attachment or posted in a private repo somewhere.
Once I locate it, I'll be sure to upload it.
